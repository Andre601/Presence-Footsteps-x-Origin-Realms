### Allow multiple pack versions

The Resource pack now makes use of `supported_formats` to allow multiple versions to be supported.

Keep in mind that this option is *not retroactively supported* meaning it cannot support versions before the one that introduced this feature (1.20.2+).  
As such was the version bumped to 1.20.2 as its lowerst version.
