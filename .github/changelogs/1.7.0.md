### Origin Realms 1.7.0 support
- Added support for 1.7.0 blocks of Origin Realms

**Note:**  
I've encountered a bug where blocks (especially note blocks with `powered=true`) would play the wrong sounds. If you encounter this bug too, try [v1.9.1-beta.3](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.9.1-beta.3) or Presence Footsteps as that fixed it for me.
