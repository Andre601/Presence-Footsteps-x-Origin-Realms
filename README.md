# Presence Footsteps x Origin Realms
This is a resource pack for the [Presence Footsteps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps) Mod, a mod that enhances sounds for walking on blocks.

## The goal
The goal of this resource pack is to make the Presence Footsteps mod compatible with the [Origin Realms](https://originrealms.com) Minecraft server, which adds new custom blocks by utilizing note blocks with different instruments and notes set.

**Remember to disable this resource pack if you play on other servers, as it overrides the default sounds for the different note block variants!**
