# Presence Footsteps x Origin Realms
This is a resource pack for the [Presence Footsteps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps) Mod, a mod that enhances sounds for walking on blocks.

## The goal
The goal of this resource pack is to make the Presence Footsteps mod compatible with the [Origin Realms](https://originrealms.com) Minecraft server, which adds new custom blocks by utilizing note blocks with different instruments and notes set.

**Remember to disable this resource pack if you play on other servers, as it overrides the default sounds for the different note block variants!**

## Note about Presence Footsteps
This resource pack requires AT LEAST `PresenceFootsteps-r34-1.18.jar` to function properly.

## Disclaimer
**THIS RESOURCE PACK IS NOT SUPPORTED BY NOR AFFILIATED OR ENDORSED BY THE DEVS OF ORIGIN REALMS NOR THE PRESENCE FOOTSTEPS MOD.**
